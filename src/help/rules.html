		<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Mahjong solitaire or MahJongg solitaire also known as Shanghai solitaire, single-player mahjong or one-player mahjong, is a solitaire matching game that uses a set of Mahjong tiles. The 144 tiles are arranged in a special layout with their faces upwards. A tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.</p>

<h1>Object of the Game</h1>
<p>The object of the game is to clear the playing area of tiles by matching pairs of tiles. Players can remove only those matching pairs of tiles where each tile has at least one side (left or right) free and no other tiles placed on top. Matching tile pairs can be removed by clicking on each tile in the pair.</p>

<h1>Playing the Game</h1>
<p>A player can only remove the tiles one pair at a time. There are a total of 72 pairs in a game of MahJong Solitaire. Like cards, the tiles have standard suits. These suits are Characters, Bamboos, Circles, Dragons, Winds, Seasons, and Flowers as shown below:</p>

<h2>Bamboo (4 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Bamboo.jpg">

<h2>Character (4 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Character.jpg">

<h2>Dragon (4 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Dragon.jpg">

<h2>Wind (4 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Wind.jpg">

<h2>Flower (1 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Flower.jpg">

<h2>Season (1 of each):</h2> <img src="images/Season.jpg">

<p>When matching pairs, Seasons and Flowers are the only suits you do not need to match exactly. Any Season or Flower combination counts as a pair because there is only one of each tile.</p>
