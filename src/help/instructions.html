		<h1>Instructions</h1>

		<p>If you have any questions about how this version of Mah Jong Solitare works, refer to the instructions below:</p>

		<h2>Clicking on a Tile</h2>

		<p>When you click on a removable tile, a red border will appear around it.  Unless the next tile you click on matches this particular tile, you will not be able to click on any other tiles.  If you wish to select a different tile, click on this same tile again and the red border will dissaper, allowing you to click on other tiles again.</p>

		<h2>Starting a New Game</h2>

		<p>To start a new game, select the "Game->Play" option in the menu bar.</p>

		<h2>Restarting a Current Game</h2>

		<p>To set the game you are currently playing back to the beginning, select the "Game->Restart" option in the menu bar.</p>
		
		<h2>Toggle Sound</h2>

		<p>To toggle the game's sound on or off, select the corresponding option in the "Sound" menu bar option.</p>

		<h1>Features</h1>		

		<p>This version of Mah Jong Solitare comes with various different features that will improve your playing experience.  These features are described below:</p>

		<h2>Numbered Game</h2>
		<p>At the start of the program, you will be prompted to either start a whole new game or to play a numbered game.  A numbered game is a game in which you've played before that you have defined by such by choosing the "Games->Number" option on the menu bar.  The number of this game will appear on the far right side of the screen after you have clicked on this option.</p>
		<p>If you chose to play a numbered game, you will be prompted to enter the number of the game that you wish to replay.  As such, it is important that you remember this number when it is given to you.</p>

		<h2>View Removed Tiles</h2>
		<p>If you click on the "Moves->Vew" option in the menu bar, a window will appear.  This window shows the tiles that you have removed, with the most recent starting on the left and scrolling to the right.  This should prove to be very useful to you as you plan out each of your moves.</p>

		<h2>Undo Last Move</h2>
		<p>By clicking on the "Moves->Undo" option in the menu bar, you will be able to undo each of your most recent moves if you make a mistake at some point in your game.</p>
